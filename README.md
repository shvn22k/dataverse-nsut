## Overview

This repository contains a collection of experiment scripts and submissions for a data challenge. It is a raw working directory, not a polished library or tutorial.

## Note

The scripts are pragmatic snapshots meant to run and produce outputs, not to explain methodology in depth. Many submissions were overwritten by new modidifications so can't say much. Haha.

## Structure

- `Round 1/` and `Round 2/`: folders with multiple submission variants and related utilities
- `data/` references inside scripts point to local CSVs used for runs
- Notebooks are for ad‑hoc exploration; they are not cleaned for publication


Outputs (like submissions) are written next to the scripts.

## Disclaimer

This codebase is intentionally minimal on explanations and comments. It’s optimized for getting results, not for readability or education.
